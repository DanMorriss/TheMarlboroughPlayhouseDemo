    Welcome to The Play House — a beautifully designed space where little
    imaginations run wild and grown-ups can actually enjoy a coffee while it
    happens!
  </p>
  <p class="max-w-[800px] mx-auto">
    We’re a family-run soft play café based in the heart of Marlborough, created
    with one simple goal: to offer a calm, beautiful play space for 0-8 year
    olds - a warm, welcoming environment that works just as well for toddlers as
    it does for tired parents.
  </p>
  <p class="max-w-[800px] mx-auto">
    Our custom-built mini play town wraps around the room and features a
    builder’s yard (complete with foam bricks and high-vis vests), a cosy café,
    pretend shops, an arts & crafts corner and more — all made from wood,
    thoughtfully designed, and just the right size for curious little ones.
  </p>
  <p class="max-w-[800px] mx-auto">
    We’ve also designed our café with grown-ups in mind — whether you're here to
    catch up with friends, take five with a flat white, or settle into a beanbag
    while your baby snoozes. With healthy snacks for kids, plenty of high chairs
    and bouncers, and a rotating menu of events and quieter sessions, we’ve
    tried to think of everything.
  </p>
  <h2>Join the Play</h2>
  <p class="max-w-[800px] mx-auto">
    Whether it’s your little one’s first crawl, a rainy-day retreat, or your
    go-to meet-up spot, we can’t wait to welcome you.
  </p>
  <p class="max-w-[800px] mx-auto">
    Come for the coffee. Stay for the memories.
